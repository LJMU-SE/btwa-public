## Project Objective

The aim of this project is to recreate the slow motion cinematic "bullet-time" effect used in the Matrix movies.

## Hardware

This project consists of one master node, running on a high powered computer, and 42 "slave" nodes, each running on a Raspberry Pi 4B (4GB RAM). Each slave node has a PiCamera attached, and communicates with the master node via websockets.

## Operating Modes

There are 3 operating modes for this project:

-   Freeze Frame
-   Slow Motion (Bullet-Time)
-   Light Painting
